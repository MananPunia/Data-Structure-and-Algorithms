# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms
This is the repo where I will be uploading regular Data Structures and Algorithms

Whats up my fellow developers, this repo will hold a journey, a journey where I will be taking my first step towards contributing to open source or atleast whatever other devs call this.
I dont know when to update readmes like do I have to update this file regular , what to embark here, like do I have to post daywise.there are so many quetions which my brain holds but I think as I move forward these will be cleared, so lets begin.
Also I dont have more of a development side to post here, I have done DSA in past so for the begining lets begin with this😺
